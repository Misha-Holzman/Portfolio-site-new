            I am a New York City based web and visual designer, with the goal of using my professional skill and experience to make an impact 
            in environmental conservation and climate change by improving the unbalanced relationship humans have with the environment. 
            I graduated college with a B.S. in Business and Management and returned to school to pursue Front End Web Development and Web Design, 
            leading me to blend a business oriented mindset with creative and technical ability as a professional designer. 
            My work drives business and exposure through intelligent user-flow, business understanding, collaboration, ease of use, 
            intuitive consistency, and an artistic eye for modern cohesive design. I am passionate about helping companies and individuals express who they are and
            what they represent by creating beautiful interfaces and engaging experiences that drive real results. My goal is to create an elegant combination of form and function.
