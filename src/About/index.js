            <p className='main-text'>
            I was born in raised in NYC surrounded by art and design. I love to create art and music in my free time and I cultivate my creative drive in web development. I studied business and management in college, and I have found that such a background gives me a great advantage when creating effective and engaging user experiences on a website.

            I understand the importance of aligning a company or individualâ€™s online presence with their brand, vision, values, and positioning within an industry. A visit to a website is a lot like physically walking into a store. Every part of the visit, from the lighting to the font on the walls will impact how you feel about the product while inside and help shape your opinion of the brand.
